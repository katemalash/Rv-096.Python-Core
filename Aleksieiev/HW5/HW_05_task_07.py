In chess, queens can move any number of sqaueres horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
Given the location of your queen and your opponents' queen, determine whethere or not
you're able to capture your opponents' queen. Your location and your opponents' location
are the first and second elements of the list, respectively.
['A1', 'H8'] -> True
['A1', 'C2'] -> False
['G3', 'E5'] -> True
